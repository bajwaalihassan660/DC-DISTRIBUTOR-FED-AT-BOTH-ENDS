# DC-DISTRIBUTOR-FED-AT-BOTH-ENDS
DC DISTRIBUTOR FED AT BOTH ENDS (HARDWARE)
I designed a DC distributor system that is fed power from both ends. This project involved creating a distribution network where DC power is supplied and distributed from multiple sources simultaneously. I utilized circuit design principles to ensure efficient power distribution and management. Through this project, I gained practical experience in designing and implementing DC distribution systems, optimizing power flow, and ensuring reliability in dual-fed configurations.

Skills Gained:
DC Power Distribution Design
Circuit Design for Dual-fed Systems
Power Flow Optimization
Practical Experience in Power Management
Understanding of Redundancy and Reliability in Distribution Systems
